This is my first application for any coding language. It simulates a real vending machine transaction. Insert money, select item code you'd like to purchse, dispenses the item, and gives you back change.

Transaction data is logged into a file to transaction history.

A sales report is also logged that keeps track of total items sold and gross profit of all item sold.

Although the coding is rough around the edges, it is functional. Refactoring is needed but will likely not happen as my time is heavily being spent learning other languages and frameworks.
